1. This coding challenge is done in Java.
2. I have used ArrayList(ie. The data comming as parameter to the functions is of type arraylsit). 
3. In searchContinuityAboveValue() and backSearchContinuityWithinRange(), if none of the conditions satisfies then -1 is returned.
3. The searchContinuityAboveValueTwoSignals() will return an arraylist with two elements. The first index where both data1 and data2 
have values that meet these criteria for at least winLength samples 
4. The searchMultiContinuityWithinRange() returns an arraylist with two elements the starting index and ending index of all continuous 
samples that meet this criteria for at least winLength data points.
5. In searchContinuityAboveValueTwoSignals() and searchMultiContinuityWithinRange(), if none of the condition satisfies, then arraylist
with (-1,-1)elements is returned.
